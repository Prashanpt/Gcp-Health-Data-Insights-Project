# 🩺 Health Insights Project - GCP Data Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to generate **health insights** by processing and analyzing patient-level data using a scalable and serverless architecture on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. The data flows through multiple GCP services — from ingestion to final reporting in BigQuery — to enable actionable analytics.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** – Raw data staging & temporary processing outputs
- **Dataproc (PySpark on Hadoop/YARN)** – Distributed data transformation and standard deviation computation
- **BigQuery** – Final data warehouse for visualization and BI reporting

## 📄 File Description

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `main_pipeline.py` | Core PySpark script used in Dataproc to read from GCS, process data, compute aggregations and standard deviations, and write the result to BigQuery |
| `README.md` | Documentation for understanding and running the project |
| `sample_data/` | Contains mock or real input data used in the pipeline |
| `output/` | Holds intermediate output for validation or debugging |

---

## 📌 GCP Resources

| Resource | Name/Link |
|----------|-----------|
| GCS Bucket | `gs://your-bucket-name/health-insights/` |
| Dataproc Cluster | `health-insights-cluster` (Region: `us-central1`) |
| BigQuery Table | `your_project.health_dataset.final_insights` |

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔁 Step 1: Upload input data to GCS
```bash
gsutil cp local_file.csv gs://your-bucket-name/health-insights/input/
````

### 🔁 Step 2: Submit the PySpark job to Dataproc

```bash
gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark main_pipeline.py \
    --cluster=health-insights-cluster \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --jars=gs://spark-lib/bigquery/spark-bigquery-latest.jar
```

### 🔁 Step 3: Verify in BigQuery

Go to BigQuery and query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM `your_project.health_dataset.final_insights`
```

---

## 📊 Example Use Case

Compute standard deviation of lab test results per patient and flag anomalies:

* Patients with unusually high/low test results
* Time-series trends for health monitoring

### 📝 Tips:
- Replace placeholders like `your_project`, `your-bucket-name`, `your-profile` with your actual project details.
- You can add badges (like GCP, PySpark, BigQuery) at the top if you're uploading to GitHub.

Let me know if you'd like me to generate a logo, add GitHub Actions for CI/CD, or include a `.json` schema validator example!
